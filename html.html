        <p>
            The climax of this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_as_food"> course</a> is its final project.
            The
            final project is your opportunity to take your newfound
            savvy
            with programming out for a spin and develop your very own piece of software. So long as your project draws
            upon
            this
            course’s lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you. You may implement your project in any
            language(s). You are welcome to utilize infrastructure other than the CS50 Codespace. All that we ask is
            that
            you
            build something of interest to you, that you solve an actual problem, that you impact your community, or
            that
            you
            change the world. Strive to create something that outlives this course.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inasmuch as software development is rarely a one-person effort, you are allowed an opportunity to
            collaborate
            with
            one
            or two classmates for this final project. Needless to say, it is expected that every student in any such
            group
            contribute equally to the design and implementation of that group’s project. Moreover, it is expected that
            the
            scope
            of
            a two- or three-person group’s project be, respectively, twice or thrice that of a typical one-person
            project. A
            one-person project, mind you, should entail more time and effort than is required by each of the course’s
            problem
            sets.
